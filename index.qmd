### Hello!

My name is Michael Zargari. I am a <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science" target="_blank"> Master of Environmental Data Science</a> student at the <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management</a> at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB). I graduated from UCSB in 2022 with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, B.A. in Economics, and minors in Iranian Studies and Translation Studies. I started my academic career in 2018 as a Judith Stapelmann Scholar and was awarded the Jeremy D. Friedman Memorial Award in June 2022.

Coming from a unique background, I have a wide range of experience completing internships at globally recognized companies AIG and Lyft and participating in research at UCSB where I have completed work as a data analyst, data scientist, statistical researcher, underwriter, and actuary.

My goal is to continue these efforts to influence climate policy at the corporate, national, and state levels.
