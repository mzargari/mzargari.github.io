## Volunteering

In my free time, I like contributing to the Persian Jewish community. Currently, I am working with the Jewish Languages Project researching ancient Judeo-Persian Languages, a project that has led to very interesting theories and newly discovered concepts.

Below are a few videos that I have worked on to transliterate and translate from the target language to English and Farsi.
