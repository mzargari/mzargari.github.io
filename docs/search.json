    "text": "My name is Michael Zargari. Welcome to my website! Feel free to browse around. You can change the theme (dark/light) of the website using the toggle on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar.\n\n\nI am a  Master of Environmental Data Science student at the  Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB). I graduated from UCSB in 2022 with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, B.A. in Economics, and minors in Iranian Studies and Translation Studies. I started my academic career in 2018 as a Judith Stapelmann Scholar and was awarded the Jeremy D. Friedman Memorial Award in June 2022.\nOn my free time, I like contributing to campus projects and participating on various student committees. My latest passion is with Judeo-Persian Languages which I have been working on since the Pandemic.\nOn the data side, I have a wide range of experience using R, Python, and SQL. I have concluded internships at globally recognized companies AIG and Lyft and participating in research at UCSB where I have completed work as a data analyst, data scientist, statistical researcher, underwriter, and actuary.\nAs data science is a largely applicable skillset, my goal is to continue these efforts within a wide range of goals. Whether that is assessing risk, analyzing data, or to influence climate policy at the corporate, national, and state levels."
