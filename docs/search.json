    "text": "My name is Michael Zargari. Welcome to my website! Feel free to browse around. You can change the theme of the website using the toggle on the top right hand corner of the navigation bar.\n\n\nI am a  Master of Environmental Data Science student at the  Bren School of Environmental Science & Management at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB). I graduated from UCSB in 2022 with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, B.A. in Economics, and minors in Iranian Studies and Translation Studies. I started my academic career in 2018 as a Judith Stapelmann Scholar and was awarded the Jeremy D. Friedman Memorial Award in June 2022 for my avid involvement on campus.\nIn my free time, I like contributing to campus projects and participating on various student committees. My latest passion is researching ancient Judeo-Persian Languages, a project that has led to very interesting theories and newly discovered concepts.\nOn the data side, I have a wide range of experience using R, Python, and SQL. I have completed internships at globally recognized companies AIG and Lyft, as well as on-campus research at UCSB where I have worked as a data analyst, data scientist, statistical researcher, underwriter, and actuary.\nAs data science is a largely applicable skill-set, I am eager to apply my acquired knowledge and skills to a spectrum of real world applications to analyze data, create accurate models, assess risk, and influence climate and environmental policy, among other initiatives."
