::: {#hero-heading}
I graduated with a <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science" target="_blank"> Master of Environmental Data Science</a> from the <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management</a> at the University of California-Santa Barbara (UCSB). I was selected as an inaugural [Putnam Promise Fellow](https://www.graddiv.ucsb.edu/promise-fellowship-program) and was honored with the University Award of Distinction at the end of my program.\
\
I completed my undergraduate degree from UCSB in 2022 with a B.S. in Statistics and Data Science, B.A. in Economics, and minors in Iranian Studies and Translation Studies. I started my academic career in 2018 as a Judith Stapelmann Scholar and was awarded the Jeremy D. Friedman Memorial Award in June 2022 for my avid involvement on campus.\
\
I studied abroad at the University of Edinburgh during Fall 2021 which solidified my interest in pursuing a higher degree in data science.\
\
I have further outlined my educational history below! Feel free to read on.
